# Tetris
Block Game

A block game which we played in our childhood. It consists of Tetriminos, which are geometric shapes composed of four square blocks each. A random sequence of Tetriminos falls down the playing field. The objective of the game is to manipulate these Tetriminos, by moving each one sideways and/or rotating, so that they form a solid horizontal line with no gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. It also has functionalities like undo and redo if the user makes a wrong move.
